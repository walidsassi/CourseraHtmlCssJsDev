              Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated 
			fat than most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.
			Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). 
The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, 
compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.
However, according to a 2006 Harvard School of Public Health study of 135,000 people, 
people who ate grilled skinless chicken 5 or more times a week had a 52 percent higher 
chance of developing bladder cancer compared to people who did not. 
However, such strong associations were not found in individuals regularly consuming chicken with skin intact.
In many factory farms, chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive Roxarsone, 
an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens, 
and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer.The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. 
In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that 
did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA.
The FDA has since revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that 
"any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern."
Information obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) 
"strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use of 
the drug in poultry production." According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, 
the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to 
discourage infection of hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry, 
antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs.
A recent study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat 
and poultry in US grocery stores was contaminated with S. aureus, 
with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
Furthermore, as per the FDA, more than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different classes of 
antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States.An estimated 90-100% of conventional chicken contains, 
at least, one form of antibiotic resistance microorganism. While organic chicken has been found to have a lower incidence at 84%.
In random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012, 
the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples to contain fecal matter. 
In poultry farms and in transportation to slaughter houses, chickens defecate on themselves and stand in their own feces. 
There is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed.
With slaughter lines processing up to 140 birds/minute, safety inspectors do not have adequate time to properly examine visible fecal matter.

	Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. 
	Beef can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers. 
	Its acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.
	Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak 
	(filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.) 
	Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, 
	leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage. 
	Other parts that are eaten include the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands 
	(particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain 
	(although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), 
	the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, 
	prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, 
	but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.
			
	Grilling	is cooking the beef over or under a high radiant heat source, generally in excess of 650 °F (343 °C). 
	This leads to searing of the surface of the beef, which creates a flavorsome crust. 
	In Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the UK, Germany and The Netherlands, 
	grilling, particularly over charcoal, is sometimes known as barbecuing, often shortened to "BBQ". 
	When cooked over charcoal, this method can also be called charbroiling.
Barbecue	refers to a technique of cooking that involves cooking meat 
for long periods of time at low temperatures with smoke from a wood fire.
Broiling	is a term used in North America. It is similar to grilling, but with the heat source always above the meat. 
Elsewhere this is considered a way of grilling.
Griddle	Meat may be cooked on a hot metal griddle. A little oil or fat may be added to inhibit sticking; the dividing line when the method becomes shallow frying is not well-defined.
Roasting	is a way of cooking meat in a hot oven, producing roast beef. Liquid is not usually added; the beef may be basted by fat on the top, or by spooning hot fat from the oven pan over the top. A gravy may be made from the cooking juices, after skimming off excess fat. Roasting is suitable for thicker pieces of meat; the other methods listed are usually for steaks and similar cuts
			
Kobe beef is pure Tajima-gyu breed bull, that was born, raised, and slaughtered solely within the Hyogo prefecture. Very limited amounts of Kobe are exported.[12]
Halal beef has been certified to have been processed in a prescribed manner in accordance with Muslim dietary laws.
Kosher beef has been certified to have been processed in a prescribed manner in accordance with Jewish dietary laws.
Organic beef is produced without added hormones, pesticides, or other chemicals, though requirements for labeling it organic vary widely.
The EU recognises the following Protected Designation of Origin beef brands:
Spain – Carne de Ávila, Carne de Cantabria, Carne de la Sierra de Guadarrama, Carne de Morucha de Salamanca, Carne de Vacuno del País o Euskal Okela, Ternera Galega
France – Taureau de Camargue, Boeuf charolais du Bourbonnais, Boeuf de Chalosse, Boeuf du Maine
United Kingdom – Orkney Beef, Scotch Beef, Welsh Beef

Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨?) is a food preparation originating in Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared rice 
(鮨飯 sushi-meshi?) combined with other ingredients (ネタ neta?) such as raw seafood, vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. 
Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice 
(also referred to as shari (しゃり?) or sumeshi (酢飯?)).
Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. 
It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients or are vegetarian. 
Raw fish (or occasionally other meat) sliced and served without rice is called "sashimi". Sushi is often served with pickled ginger 
(ガリ gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made using daikon.

Health risks
Some of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) 
can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity 
or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who might get pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children.
According to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections world-wide from eating raw fish. 
This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or 
treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus.
 Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, 
 anemia, liver disease, and more. The impact of these 
illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby, 
but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover are also of concern as well.
Sashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:

Clonorchis sinensis, a fluke which can cause clonorchiasis
Anisakis, a roundworm which can cause anisakiasis
Diphyllobothrium, a tapeworm which can cause diphyllobothriasis
For the above reasons, EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at temperatures below −20 °C 
(−4 °F) in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours.
As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers and end users "super-freeze" fish for sushi to temperatures as low as −60 °C.
As well as parasite destruction, super-freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh, thus preventing the 
discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 °C.

Some forms of sushi, notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning
 if not prepared properly. Particularly, fugu consumption can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin 
 in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the 
 prefectural examination in Japan.
 The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test,
 and a practical test, preparing and eating the fish. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass
